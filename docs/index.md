# Community sourced sysexts for Fedora image based systems

**NOTE: This project is a work in progress. Make sure to read the [known
limitations section](https://extensions.fcos.fr). Use at your own risk.**

This sub project gathers systemd system extensions (sysexts) made from
community provided sources, upstream build binaries and COPR packages.

Those sysexts should work will all Fedora based image mode systems (Bootable
Containers (bootc) images, Atomic Desktops, CoreOS, IoT) and derivatives such
as Bluefin, Aurora or Bazzite from Universal Blue.

For sysexts built from Fedora packages only, see
[extensions.fcos.fr/fedora](https://extensions.fcos.fr/fedora).

For general explainations about systemd system extensions (sysexts) and how to
use them, see the documentation from the parent page:
[extensions.fcos.fr](https://extensions.fcos.fr).
