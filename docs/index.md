# Community sourced sysexts for Fedora image based systems

**NOTE: This project is a work in progress. Make sure to read the [known
limitations section](https://extensions.fcos.fr/known-issues). Use at your own
risk.**

This sub project gathers systemd system extensions (sysexts) made from
community provided sources, upstream build binaries and COPR packages.

For sysexts built from Fedora packages only, see
[extensions.fcos.fr/fedora](https://extensions.fcos.fr/fedora).

For general explainations about systemd system extensions (sysexts) and how to
use them, see the documentation from the parent page:
[extensions.fcos.fr](https://extensions.fcos.fr).

## Compatibility

Those sysexts should work will all Fedora based image mode systems (Atomic
Desktops, CoreOS, IoT, etc.), wether they are Bootable Containers (bootc)
images, or classic ostree/rpm-ostree systems. They should also work with
derivative images such as Bluefin, Aurora or Bazzite from the Universal Blue
project.

## Building, contributing and licenses

See the project's [README](https://github.com/fedora-sysexts/community).
